ID,Bug Line,Explanation
101,1,"Wrong vector edit mode: when copyLabel() is used, vecEditMode must be TA::VTT, not TA::VECD. VTT mode is required for label-based vector editing."
102,2,Line 2: missing_execute — DC force configuration chain must be terminated with .execute() to apply the settings; the current chain ends without an execute call.
103,1,"iClamp argument order error: iClamp(20.0, -20.0) has low and high values exchanged. First argument should be the low clamp, second should be high. Correct: iClamp(-20.0, 20.0)."
104,2,Wrong terminal method: 'read()' should be 'execute()' in this RDI measurement chain. DC and func operations require .execute() to complete.
105,3,"Line 3: invalid_argument_type — runTimeVal expects a scalar numeric value, but an ARRAY_I (vector) is passed, which is not allowed for runtime scalar substitution."
106,1,Missing parameter: getAlarmValue() requires a pin name string parameter.
107,1,Incorrect function name: '.imeas()' should be '.iMeas()'. This is a known API naming error.
108,3,"Incorrect chain order: 'rdi.burstUpload.smartVec()' should be 'rdi.smartVec().burstUpload()'. burstUpload() is a method of smartVec, not the other way around."
109,1,Pin name mismatch: pin 'D1' in setup (line 1) does not match 'DI' in retrieval (line 2). These look like they should be the same pin (possible typo: 'D1' vs 'DI').
110,1,Extra parameter: readTempThresh() takes no parameters. Remove the argument to fix this API call.
111,1,Range overflow: vForce(31.0 V) exceeds vForceRange(30.0 V). The programmed force value must always match the selected range to avoid range overflow warnings.
112,1,Line 1: missing_execute — DC configuration chain must be terminated with .execute() to apply the waveform settings; the code ends without calling execute.
113,1,Incorrect function name: '.push_forward()' should be '.push_back()'. This is a known API naming error.
114,3,"Scope violation: retrievePmuxPinStatus() should be called after RDI_END(), not inside the RDI_BEGIN/RDI_END block. Status retrieval requires the execution block to complete first."
115,1,"digCapBurstSiteUpload should be set to true for uploads. Currently set to false, should be true."
116,1,Sample count 9000 exceeds maximum allowed value of 8192.
117,1,Invalid function name 'getFFC()' — this appears to be a corrupted API name. The closest valid function is 'getFFV()'.
118,1,Line 1: missing_execute — SmartVec configuration chains must be terminated with .execute() to apply the read mode; the call ends without execute.
119,2,"Line 2: missing_lifecycle_end — RDI_BEGIN() is called but there is no matching RDI_END() in the code, violating the required RDI lifecycle management."
120,2,"Line 2: variable_mismatch — The measurement retrieval uses rdi.id(""id"") which does not match the identifier set in the configuration chain (func(""idd"")). Identifiers must be consistent across setup and read calls."
